Circular Layout ULP for Eagle
===============================

This Eagle user language program (ULP) lays out components on a board, or
pins/pads on a footprint in a circle. It was inspired by [a PHP script that
Mats created](http://www.smallroomlabs.com/eagle/circle_led.php) in PHP.

The script can be run in either a _board_ or _library_, and you can select a
subset of components to be laid out. There are also various options you can
tweak.

The ULP is mostly useful for laying out LEDs around a clock face, for example,
but can also be used to make anything into a circle.
